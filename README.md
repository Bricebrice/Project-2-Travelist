## Backlog

We were ambitious, and our backlog was... BIG. Luckily enough, we were able to deliver our MVP and some backlog items are ready for future releases...

As nice-to-haves, we can consider:

- Search by Country functionality
- Posts can only be updated by their authors
- Read only user profiles to meet new people
- Ability to comment posts for logged in users
- Redirect users to current page after log in (and not always to the same page)
- ...
